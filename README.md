1. Shopping Channel and Customer Experience
   
Overall Satisfaction: Customers report the highest overall satisfaction when shopping online (3.03%). Those who shop both online and in-store (2.91%) and those who shop only in-store (2.88%) follow closely. This indicates that the online shopping experience is generally perceived more positively.

Ease of Shopping: Interestingly, online customers, who report the highest overall satisfaction, find shopping slightly less easy compared to in-store customers. This suggests that there is potential to further improve satisfaction on your online platform by enhancing convenience factors such as payment processes or navigation.

2. Demographic Factors and Satisfaction
   
When examining the relationship between demographic characteristics such as age and income and overall satisfaction, the following results were obtained:

Correlation: The correlation coefficient between age and overall satisfaction is 0.06, while the correlation between income and overall satisfaction is 0.08. These values indicate that age and income do not have a strong linear relationship with overall satisfaction.

Conclusion: We can conclude that factors influencing customer satisfaction are more likely operational, such as service quality, product variety, or in-store experience, rather than demographic characteristics. To increase customer satisfaction, it is more effective to focus on these operational factors rather than demographic information.
